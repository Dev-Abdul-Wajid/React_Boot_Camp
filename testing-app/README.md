### Functional components

Functional components are some of the more common components that will come across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional component in React by writing a JavaScript function. These functions may or may not receive data as parameters. In the functional Components, the return value is the JSX code to render.

The shift towards functional components in React is driven by their simplicity, performance benefits, reusability


####
Two-way data binding typically involves passing data from a parent component to a child component through props and allowing the child component to update the parent component's state or data.
#### UseState()

Functional components lack a significant amount of features as compared to class-based components and they do not have access to dedicated state variables like class-based components. The gap is made up with the help of a special ReactJS concept called “hooks”. ReactJS has access to a special hook called useState().It is used to manage state within a functional component. The useState() hook allows you to declare a state variable and provides a way to update that variable, triggering a re-render of the component whenever the state changes.

#####

Functional components do not have access to lifecycle functions like class-based components do since lifecycle functions need to be defined within the boundaries of a class. A special React hook called useEffect() needs to be used. It is worth noting that useEffect() isn’t an exact duplicate of the lifecycle functions – it works and behaves in a slightly different manner.



####

Reasons: There are a few reasons why it’s recommended to use functional components over class components in React:

#### Simplicity and Readability:
Function components are simpler and easier to read and understand compared to class components. They have a more straightforward syntax and do not require the use of the this keyword.

#### No Need for Lifecycle Methods:
Function components do not have lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, or componentWillUnmount. Instead, they can use React's built-in Hooks like useEffect to achieve similar functionality.

#### Performance Optimization:
Function components are generally more performant because they have a smaller memory footprint compared to class components. 
###

Hooks: Functional components can use the React hooks, which allows you to use state and other React features in functional components, while class components can’t.
